# Limitless Lists

A website for users to create, share and journal their Bucket List.

On Limitless Lists people can register to start creating their personal
"Bucket List" of places they will go and things they will see. Goals are
essential to living a rich and fulfilling life verses dying one day at a time.

#### Video Demo: <URL HERE>

#### Description:

Limitless Lists enables individuals to dream big and set goals to travel and
experience the world! Registered users can lookup and add places of interest
to their bucket list with images and details dynamically added from the internet.
Once they have visited a place on their bucket list, they can add journal entries
sharing personal images and details of their experience.
We also provide an interactive map view of user's bucket lists to help them
visualize their goals. Finally, we urge users to share their bucket list and map
with other users to inspire others and motivate themselves to check items off their list.
